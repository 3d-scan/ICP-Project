\section{Weighted Scan Matching}

Weighted scan matching removes a simplyfying assumption from ICP, namely that ``the range scans of different poses sample the environment's boundary at \emph{exactly} the same points''~\cite{pfister2002weighted}. This introduces an error which the authors name the \emph{correspondence error}. The correspondence error is the maximum distance between each point and it's closest match, which depends on the distance among the Model points, \cite{slamet2008boosting} give a clear illustration in their Figure 1.
